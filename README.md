# Node.js MavLink mappings

This package is an attempt to make an easy to use and strongly typed library that will allow Node.js applications to communicate with drones that use the MavLink protocol

Pleasee be aware that this is still work in progress. No transpilation is being done so the only value in this project is currently only in following the development.

Cheers,
Matthias.
